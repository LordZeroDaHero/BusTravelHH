Website for Bus Business with a transparent customer-company-relationship

Aim:
To create a platform for interaction between companies and customers in the Bus Branch. Note: It's claim is not to copy existing websites but provide as much transparency for clients and companies as needed.

Background:
Using the existing Web-Sites for Bus Business it's possible for companies to take assignments without having any busses or drivers. That leads to many people working like a broker (just passing on the assignements to other companies). Obviously this means, that the customer has no ensurance that his assignement will be fullfilled. Further more it's not up the customer anymore to choose the company actually taking on the job.

Fix:
To fix this, there are several ideas: First, companies have to proof to have the capacities to take on the assignement (How? Well,...it's thinkable that u have to scan the registration document of the bus or sth). Second: There should be alternative ways/views for the customer to choose the company. [What alternative Ways? A graphic (like UML) is gonna follow soon.]
